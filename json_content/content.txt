{"title":["Department of Computer Science","Diversity in Computer Science"],"body":["For many decades, the diversity in computer science nationally has been disproportionally lower than in other science disciplines. The effort to increase our diversity in Computer Science has been energized by our participation in BRAID . We have graduated ~34% female for the last two graduating classes, nearly double the national average graduation rates. Our ability to send a greater number of our students to the Grace Hopper Conference for Women in Technology as well as additional diversity conferences each year has been directly related to our part in the BRAID initiative. Computer Science students continue to build a community that encourages women and underrepresented minorities to pursue studies in Computer Science.

{"title":["Graduate Programs","External Recognition"],"body":["  - The National Research Council's Assessment of Research Doctorate Programs (revised April 2011) ranked our department in the range 11th to 34th nationally according to one weighting of metrics (r-rankings), and in the range 9th to 48th according to the other weighting (s-rankings).\n  - Rochester had the rare distinction of receiving continuous funding from the National Science Foundation Research Infrastructure program from 1984 to 2005. Also known by the earlier names CER (Coordinated Experimental Research) and IIP (Institutional Infrastructure Program), RI grants fund the acquisition of unique, large-scale hardware resources for interdisciplinary work. At Rochester these grants recognized ground-breaking collaboration among researchers in Computer Systems, Spatial AI, Symbolic AI, and Theory.\n  - With an annual budget of over $5 million, and research expenditures around $3.5M, URCS external funding averages around $200K/faculty member per year. While larger departments often have larger total budgets, per capita funding at Rochester is very strong."],"link":["https://www.cs.rochester.edu/graduate/why-urcs.html"]}
{"title":["Graduate Programs","The Value of Being Small"],"body":["Most other top-ranked departments are 3 to 4 times our size. Smallness has an impact, of course, on the total number of students and publications, the total size of the budget, the total number of alumni, etc., but it does not have an impact on the things that really matter: the output of the department per person, and the quality of the research, the people, and the programs.","While it is difficult for a small department to compete with the sheer volume and variety of work at larger schools, there are significant advantages to being small. Many of these advantages impact quality of life, making URCS a great place to work or to get a degree. Many, however, impact research quality as well, inspiring us to do research that we probably wouldn\u2019t do at a larger school.","  - Cross-disciplinary focus \u2014 As noted above, the department places a heavy emphasis on interdisciplinary work. Small size facilitates this emphasis: groups naturally seek each other out to help build critical mass. At the University level, administrative policies make it easy to share funding and appointments across departments and schools. More locally, the department deliberately encourages \u201ccross fertilization\u201d by mixing student office space by area: the typical room houses students with three different research advisiors, working in different areas of AI, HCI, Systems, and/or Theory.\n  - Personal attention \u2014 With about 3\u20134 Ph.D. students per faculty member, on average, doctoral candidates receive a great deal of personal attention. Most students become active in research during their first year of graduate study. Beyond that first year, most learning occurs one-on-one or in small groups at the whiteboard, rather than in a classroom setting.\n  - Communal resource model \u2014 The department pools financial resources to the maximum extent consistent with granting agency guidelines. Every Ph.D. student is guaranteed support throughout the course of graduate studies, regardless of choice of advisor or research topic. A department-wide committee coordinates all major equipment purchases, to maximize the potential to meet multiple research needs. Machines are then uniformly available to all faculty, grad students, visitors, and postdocs. All Unix machines run a common password file, and all file systems are universally cross-mounted, so one can log on anywhere and feel at home.\n  - Collaborative decision making \u2014 Because the entire faculty will fit around one table, decisions can be made almost entirely by consensus. Graduate student representatives serve on all department committees, and play a major role in graduate admissions, facilities, and curricular development.\n  - Collegial atmosphere \u2014 Because everyone in the department knows everyone else, the social and professional atmosphere is unusually warm and collegial. There are weekly parties, and department teams in various intramural sports leagues."],"link":["https://www.cs.rochester.edu/graduate/why-urcs.html"]}

{"title":["Undergraduate Program","Thinking about Graduate School?"],"body":["Each year we hold a meeting for students interested in a better understanding of the graduate school application process. The following summarizes a recent conversation between undergraduate, graduate students and faculty members.","How do I pick which schools to apply to?","The best research-oriented computer science departments in the US are members of CRA, the Computing Research Association. See the list of CRA member universities. Find each department's home page, and browse their faculty and research. Approach your faculty advisor and other professors, and ask them for input about the best schools given the area of research. Apply to about 10 schools and make sure you have reach, middle and fallback schools, just like undergraduate applications.","Should I apply for fellowships?","YES, YES, YES! If you receive a fellowship prior to being accepted to a school, you are certainly considered a more attractive candidate because the school will not have to fund you. You will benefit from larger stipends, greater freedom to study at your own pace, and more. You should be sure to apply for an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Here is a list of graduate fellowships to consider.","Can I work for a year or two before attending graduate school? Do they like that or not? ","Many students do apply to graduate school after working for a period of time. Spending 1 to 3 years working before applying to graduate school will not hurt your chances, and may help if you work at a well-known research company. If you work for a longer period, however, you should make clear on your application that your academic skills are up to date. Admissions committees take letters from faculty members more seriously than letters from employers. It can be hard to get an informative letter from a faculty member you studied with several years after graduation. You should try to stay in contact with your favorite teachers, so that they can write good letters when the time comes. GRE scores are valid for five years, so it makes sense to take the GREs before completing your undergraduate degree, when the material is fresh and you are more accustomed to preparing for tests.","Should I get a Master's degree before going for my PhD?","If your end goal is a PhD, it is best to apply directly to a PhD program. Most departments use different criteria for admitting MS students, and usually provide little or no financial support for MS students. The only reasons for applying for an MS program if your end goal is a PhD is if your undergraduate grades are poor or if you majored in a subject under than computer science and took few computer science courses.","Which criteria do grad schools look at most closely?","Our faculty isn't always in agreement on this! Some consider the GPA to be most important, some give stronger weight to the letters of recommendation. All agree that GRE scores might be a first cut-off (anyone below 'x' is unlikely) to make the applicant pool more manageable. Great personal statements or letters of recommendations may give your application a second look if something else is a little weaker. Having letters of recommendation from people who are personally known by the faculty at the school to which you are applying is a great help.","What are schools looking for in a personal statement?","It's very important to show enthusiasm and potential for research ability. Though you may be sending this to many schools, it's important to look committed and show that you care about this particular school/department. Don't necessarily go to a website and reference a certain project as your only area of interest. The website may not have been updated in years and that project could be long gone. However, you might mention why a particular project on a website looked interesting to you. Indicate why you want to be a scientist. Be yourself, but be professional!","What are pitfalls in personal statements?","Unlike your undergraduate application, a personal statement for grad school should avoid references to life-altering moments, should not be schmaltzy, and doesn't need to have a gimmick. It needs to be an honest reflection of your interests without any games. Have others, including your faculty advisor, review it for suggestions before you send the application. They will have great advice for making the right impression.","If I'm invited to visit a school, what do I need to find out while I'm there?","Make sure you talk to current graduate students while you are there. What is the research process there? Ask them how their advisors handle the research process. Are you working on your own work, or are you expected to work on the principal investigator's research and fit your PhD work during your 'free' time? Will that mean it will take you longer to complete your research/degree? Will you be part of a big project group, working on a small portion of that project? Is that OK with you? Who makes the decision to admit you, the department or a particular Principal Investigator? If the department admits you, you may have more flexibility to pick your advisor and your topic. If the PI is funding you, you may be funded by him/her, and if you were to decide not to continue with that advisor, you may find it difficult to get funding. How difficult is it to switch advisors? What is the cost of living for things like housing at that school, and do students find it possible to live on the stipend they are given? How long does the average student take to complete the PhD?","Any suggested reading on this subject?"],"link":["https://www.cs.rochester.edu/undergraduate/student_life/grad_school_info.html"]}

{"title":["Undergraduate Program","Prospective Undergraduate Information FAQ"],"body":["  - What is Computer Science?   \nIn Computer Science, we study computational methods, called algorithms, for solving problems, and the systems we build to run those algorithms. We study how to think about them, how to evaluate and compare them, and how to use them to develop solutions and applications.\n  - What degrees do you offer in Computer Science?   \nWe offer BS and BA degrees, as well as a Minor in Computer Science. The BS provides rigorous preparation in all core areas of computer science and is for students interested in cutting-edge R&D careers in industry or academia. The BA provides a more flexible course of study that is good for students with interdisciplinary interests. It is popular with double majors and students interested in careers in a computer-related discipline or industry.\n  - Where do people with a Computer Science degree go after college?   \nUR CS graduates go to the best graduate schools like MIT, CMU, Berkeley, Princeton, Stanford, and others, or go to work at companies ranging from Google, Microsoft, and Apple to startups working on data science, affective computing, virtual reality, and much, much more. In a typical graduating class, about 20% of our students join full-time graduate programs upon graduation.\n  - What kind of courses do you offer?   \nOur courses are divided into introductory and pre-major courses, core Computer Science courses, and advanced courses in many different areas, often associated with our faculty members\u2019 research interests. The introductory courses teach the basics of programming, algorithmic thinking, and the design and analysis of programs. Our core courses teach formal (mathematical) models of computation and their applications, principles of computer systems, foundations of artificial intelligence, and the theory of computation. Our advanced courses range from the web to machine learning to human-computer interaction to robotics and much more.\n  - I\u2019m a freshman. How do I get started in Computer Science?   \nIncoming freshmen typically take CSC171 and MTH150 in their first term and CSC172 and their first Calculus course in their second semester. Students with AP or other advanced credit can start with CSC172 and MTH150 (see below). Once you\u2019ve completed CSC172 satisfactorily, you may declare as a CSC major and start taking the core CSC courses.\n  - I\u2019m not a freshman but I want to get into Computer Science. How do I get started?  \nYou need to take CSC171 and MTH150, followed by CSC172. You then need to complete the additional requirements for the BS or BA degree. Please note that it is generally not possible to complete a CSC degree in two years starting in the junior year.\n  - How many Computer Science majors are there?  \nStudents need to complete 3 pre-major courses (including CSC172) with an average of 2.0 in order to declare either their B.S. or B.A. major. We currently graduate about 115+ majors per year. We have no caps on the number of Computer Science majors. We have over 500 students in the CSC pipeline though not all have officially declared their majors.\n  - What if I have multiple interests?   \nThe flexibility of the Rochester Curriculum attracts students with diverse interests to the University of Rochester. More than 50% of our Computer Science majors double major or minor in another discipline, some as an outgrowth of their clusters. Common double majors and minors include Mathematics, Financial Economics, Linguistics, Brain and Cognitive Science, Studio Arts, English, Music, Digital Media Studies and Business.\n  - How big are the classes in Computer Science?   \nComputer Science is growing both nationally and at Rochester. The introductory class CSC171 is 150-200 students, with smaller lab sections and peer-run study groups of about twelve students. CSC172 and core courses average about 125-150 students each. Advanced courses average 50-75 undergraduates.\n  - How will my Advanced Placement Computer Science work be considered toward my Computer Science curriculum?   \nStudents who have completed the CEEB Advanced Placement Computer Science A exam with a score of 4 or 5 will receive 4 credits of elective CSC coursework, and will be evaluated at orientation. Please check with your CSC advisor during Orientation to be sure of accurate placement in CSC courses. Our goal is to place you correctly so that you are neither over your head or bored with the material. We also want students to be prepared for the next level course they would be expected to take.\n  - Do I need a computer in my room? What kind should I get?  \nStudents are not required to have a computer of their own when they come to campus but nearly all students do. They can access the computer science labs remotely at their convenience, from their dorm room, library or lab using ssh protocols. It doesn't matter whether your computer is a Mac or a PC, dual boot, notebook, laptop or desktop. The network on campus can accommodate any computer. Each dorm room is wired through ResNet and there is wireless access around campus. Our department's systems run Fedora Linux. For more information about the kind of computer you can purchase with educational discounts, check out the UR Tech Store: http://tech.rochester.edu/services/ur-tech-store, email: urtechstore@rochester.edu, telephone: 275-8353.\n  - What types of research can students do as undergraduates, and how soon would I be able to do it?   \nUndergraduates interested in research can work on ongoing projects in systems, theory, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction. Our research meetings are open to anyone. Students can check the department event calendar to find research meetings that might interest them. Students may need more advanced coursework to be active participants in certain projects. Interested students should approach faculty members in their area of interest and ask what level of expertise is required for them to be successful researchers. We have had students begin working on research as early as freshman year, but most wait a little longer to get started.\n  - What opportunities are there for me to work (including internships)?  \nOn-campus job opportunities abound for computer-literate students! Whether you work for University Information Technology in the campus computing facility, for ResNet connecting the dorms, in departments doing computation on research, or at Strong Memorial Hospital in a medical application, there are plenty of jobs on campus.\n  - Students interested in gaining on-the-job experience during the summer have many options. In previous years, we have had students do summer internships at Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, IBM, NASA, Xerox, Intel, FactSet, 1010Data, Mathworks, Khan Academy, Zappos, Vistaprint, LinkedIn, Yahoo, HBO, Etsy, Shutterstock, Leapfrog, GoDaddy, etc. We have also had students do fellowships, REUs (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) or mentorships at MIT, the National Institute of Standards (NIST) and at other colleges around the country. Due to course scheduling, we do not have a formal co-op program for students to work full time through the academic year. We encourage students to work in the summers between academic years to get hands-on experience. Many students return to campus for their senior year with job offers from their summer employers. \n  - Those seeking employment after graduation can work with the University of Rochester Gwen M. Greene Career and Internship Center, follow leads sent directly to our faculty or staff, or network through our alumni working in well-placed positions throughout the computer industry. Recent graduates have entertained multiple offers with very competitive salary ranges at large companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Intel, Facebook, LinkedIn, Vistaprint, and Apple as well as throughout the country at companies big and small.\n  - Can I study abroad as a CSC major?   \nAbsolutely! Each semester we have several students who are studying abroad but we would like to encourage more students to discover the benefits of this global experience. Many of the students are attending English-speaking programs in Hungary, Australia, United Kingdom, Spain, Sweden, and Israel, and taking courses in both technical and non-technical fields. Some students (many who double major in a foreign language) choose to go to countries where the courses are not in English and fulfill requirements for their foreign language major. If you are interested in studying abroad, a four-year course plan can be worked out to see what semesters are optimum for your global experience and make it happen. CSC students have studied in Germany, Belgium, Russia, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Scotland, England, Spain, Sweden, France, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Hungary and China.\n  - What kind of equipment is used in the department?  \nStudent labs in the computer science department are equipped with workstations running Fedora Linux. There are 2 undergraduate student labs, one on the 2nd floor of Wegmans Hall (for declared majors only) and the other in Hylan 301. Students may also connect remotely from anywhere to work on the servers. Students involved in research with faculty have access to a wide variety of high-performance computing clusters and specialized equipment in the Human-Computer Interaction and Machine Vision laboratories.\n  - What can I do to better prepare for the Computer Science major?  \nComputer programming requires a lot of practice. If you have the opportunity to program in any language (Java, C, C++, Perl, Python, Ruby, LISP, etc.) it will benefit you. However, our curriculum is designed so that if you have never had any programming, you will have the ability to start with the basics and work your way up. Those students who have considerable coursework and experience in CS will also have opportunities for advancement at a more individual pace. Since student experience varies greatly, your advisor will review your history before recommending your course of study.\n  - Can I start a major in Computer Science as a junior?  \nOur program is designed to take four years. Depending on how things go in the early years, some students will have completed their major requirements before the start of their senior year. However due to the sequential nature of the pre-major and core courses, it is impossible to complete the BS requirements and almost impossible to complete the BA requirements in four semesters. In addition, our pre-major and core courses are very popular and often fill up early. Some introductory courses also reserve places for freshmen and/or sophomores. We therefore STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST attempting a Computer Science major starting in the junior year. A more realistic plan for a student with a late-developing interest in Computer Science is a minor.\n  - Can I double-major in Data Science?  \nComputer Science and Data Science share many courses, so double-majoring is not allowed. Students in Data Science may minor in CSC however. If you are a CSC major interested in data science and analytics, you may choose your advanced electives in CSC to specialize in courses that Data Science students are required to take (such as CSC240, CSC246, and CSC261).\n  - What is the difference between Computer Science & Electrical and Computer Engineering? Can I do both?  \nComputer science focuses on software while computer engineers focus on hardware. The CS and ECE departments overlap and collaborate in the area of computer architecture. Although CS is part of the Hajim School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, its curriculum requirements are more similar to those of the College of Arts & Sciences. CS majors are required to complete two clusters, while ECE majors are required to complete only one. ECE majors are required to take physics and chemistry, but CS majors are not. The ECE program is accredited by ABET (the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology), which is significant for students who wish to become a licensed Professional Engineer. Computer scientists rarely become licensed Professional Engineers.\n  - We have had students who have completed both an engineering curriculum and the computer science curriculum. A student who chooses to tackle this difficult double degree should have some AP credits, excellent time-management skills, and have few outside activities that distract from the difficult workload. A student may also need to plan to overload courses each semester, take summer courses, or extend beyond 4 years. Students may also choose to minor in either, while majoring in the other department.\n  - What is the BS/MS Program, and could I be a candidate for it?  \nThe BS/MS Program allows students to complete a Masters Degree by the end of their 5th year. Students interested in this program would have AP/transfer credits as entering freshmen that allow them a more advanced standing. With careful schedule planning in the sophomore year, a student could arrange to complete undergraduate requirements (128 credits) and begin graduate requirements (30 credits) while still an undergraduate. However, only 10 credits taken prior to completion of a bachelor degree may count toward the student\u2019s graduate program. Students spend the fifth year taking the remaining graduate requirements. Application to the program is made in the senior year by completing the UR graduate application. Letters of recommendation from UR faculty and a minimum GPA will be required.\n  - Is there a student organization for Computer Science majors?  \nThe Computer Science Undergraduate Council (CSUG) is an active group that does both social and academic events that are well attended by majors and non-majors alike. Students at any grade level are encouraged to become active in CSUG events. There are other clubs such as RocHack, UR WIC (Women in Computing) and UR Robotics, and competition teams for ACM Programming Competition and CS Games. These clubs give students hands-on experience, application design, problem solving and a \u201cmaker\u201d culture that inspires innovation and discovery."],"link":["https://www.cs.rochester.edu/undergraduate/student_life/FAQ.html"]}

{"title":["Graduate Programs","PhD Thesis Proposal"],"body":["After passing the area process you must form a thesis committee and defend a thesis proposal. The proposal defense constitutes the \u2018Ph.D. qualifying exam\u2019 discussed in the University\u2019s Graduate Studies Bulletin and Regulations and Policies Concerning Graduate Studies.","Students must perform research that is a significant contribution to the field during their third year. This can be satisfied by:","  - Writing a paper that is accepted in a respectable refereed conference or journal\n  - Producing a paper of similar quality (quality of paper judged by the dissertation advisory committee)\n  - Incorporating the contribution in the required thesis proposal"],"link":["https://www.cs.rochester.edu/graduate/phd-proposal.html"]}
{"title":["Graduate Programs","PhD Thesis Proposal","Dissertation Advisor and Preliminary Advisory Committee"],"body":["Soon after passing the area process, you should concentrate on narrowing down your interests to more specific ideas, such as:","  - \u201cTruth Maintenance in Natural Language\u201d\n  - \u201cCollapsing Complexity Classes via Counting\u201d\n  - \u201cParallel Visual Shape Recognition\u201d\n  - \u201cLatency Tolerance in Distributed Shared Memory Systems\u201d","Part of this process will be exploring ideas with faculty and finding a dissertation advisor and a preliminary advisory committee.","All students must register their dissertation advisor and a preliminary advisory committee with the graduate coordinator no later than December 31 in their third year.","Your advisor will play a major role of guiding you through the process of completing a PhD. Your advisor will:","  - Help you in planning your thesis proposal defense\n  - Point you towards to appropriate literature\n  - Advise proposal-related (and other) research\n  - Read drafts of your proposal\n  - Giving general advice","The advisor also plays a crucial role in the actual exam itself. Choosing an advisor should not be done lightly; changing advisors can significantly delay completion of your studies.","The preliminary advisory committee must contain:","  - Your dissertation advisor\n  - At least three University of Rochester faculty members holding the rank of at least assistant professor\n  - Three department members*","*This is a department requirement. Exceptions can be granted by the chair.","A faculty member from outside the department can also be included, and must be included when the final dissertation advisory committee is formed in the second term of the third year."],"link":["https://www.cs.rochester.edu/graduate/phd-proposal.html"]}
{"title":["Graduate Programs","PhD Thesis Proposal","Thesis Topic"],"body":["After choosing an advisor and a general category, the next step is to decide what you really want to do. This involves finding, with the help of your advisor, a suitable topic.","After choosing a topics students should search through literature to answer the following questions:","  - What (if anything) has been done already?\n  - What has not been done?\n  - What are the major gaps in previous work?\n  - What are recognized \u201cnext steps\u201d?","After you have a grasp of the area and the problem, you will need to outline how your research will address the problem. This outline should include ideas on:","  - How the research will attack the problem\n  - What it will not attack\n  - How it will fit in with previous work\n  - What the essential contribution of the work will be","You should be actively engaged in research on the topic by the fall of your third year."],"link":["https://www.cs.rochester.edu/graduate/phd-proposal.html"]}
{"title":["Graduate Programs","PhD Thesis Proposal","Dissertation Advisory Committee"],"body":["Your preliminary advisory committee members will usually become your dissertation advisory committee. If your preliminary advisory committee had no outside member, you must bring one on board at this time.","The committee members should be Rochester faculty members holding the rank of at least assistant professor, and three should be from the Department of Computer Science. (For exceptions, see the section above on .)","Each member must sign your thesis proposal defense form immediately after the thesis proposal defense. Your advisor should promptly return this form to the graduate program secretary."],"link":["https://www.cs.rochester.edu/graduate/phd-proposal.html"]}
{"title":["Graduate Programs","PhD Thesis Proposal","Producing a Thesis Proposal"],"body":["This proposal should explain:","  - The context of the problem\n  - The problem itself\n  - Previous approaches\n  - Your proposed research","You should also include a well-researched bibliography. The thesis proposal should be of high quality in style, content, and exposition.","The thesis proposal and all other publications you have written during the year should be distributed to the dissertation advisory committee at least ten days before your thesis proposal defense. Students should ideally distribute materials before even scheduling the defense.","The thesis proposal will usually describe your:","  - Third-year research\n  - The specific research directions you will pursue in the immediate future\n  - The general research directions you will pursue in the more distant future\n  - The theme that will unify your research into a coherent PhD dissertation","The thesis proposal should demonstrate that you have acquired the skills needed to perform dissertation-quality research. You are expected to have performed new research of substantial strength and novelty since your area paper. Except in exceptional cases, this new research should be appropriate for inclusion in the dissertation.","The thesis proposal should demonstrate that you have the technical strength needed to do PhD-quality research, and the vision to see the \u201cbig picture\u201d into which that research fits.","Furthermore, the thesis proposal should show that you not only know how to solve problems, but also how to frame the issues.","Finally, the thesis proposal should demonstrate that you have developed strong and insightful intuitions as to which research themes are promising. The thesis proposal defense serves to verify these points.","In short, the proposal, talk, and exam should demonstrate to the dissertation advisory committee that an entire dissertation is indeed likely to result within a reasonable time frame.","A successful thesis proposal is not a guaranteed formula for producing a successful dissertation. As the research progresses, the research goals may change dynamically, and some initial goals may be too hard to be solved within the time frame.","We therefore expect that the dissertation project will evolve to meet these contingencies, and that this evolution will be the primary topic of six-month reviews."],"link":["https://www.cs.rochester.edu/graduate/phd-proposal.html"]}
{"title":["Graduate Programs","PhD Thesis Proposal","Scheduling the Thesis Proposal Defense"],"body":["Once sufficient feedback on the thesis proposal has been gathered, you can schedule the Thesis Proposal Defense. This is best done early in the spring of the third year, though it can be done earlier, and must be done before the spring PAS.","When you are ready to schedule the thesis proposal defense, see the graduate program secretary to reserve a room and date, and to complete a Thesis Proposal Defense Appointment Form.","The graduate program secretary will not schedule more than two events in the same day\u2014one in the morning and one in the afternoon\u2014to ensure the availability of interested faculty members. Students should try to schedule events well in advance to make sure they meet the spring PAS deadline."],"link":["https://www.cs.rochester.edu/graduate/phd-proposal.html"]}
{"title":["Graduate Programs","PhD Thesis Proposal","Defending the Thesis Proposal"],"body":["A public presentation is a required part of the thesis proposal defense. It is a chance for you to publicly present your ideas to the community and for your committee to judge both the ideas and the presentation.","The presentation should take no more than an hour, and should concentrate on the proposed research and the current year\u2019s research progress.","You should provide the department secretary with the date, time, place, and abstract of the talk at least ten days in advance. She will then advertise the talk to the faculty, staff, and students.","The actual exam, which will normally occur immediately following the public presentation, is a meeting of the dissertation advisory committee and the student. Other faculty may attend and freely question and comment.","The purpose of the exam is for the committee\u2014now that it has read the thesis proposal and heard the public talk\u2014to ask you further questions and give you feedback.  \nQuestions may address any aspect of the proposal, including the actual research, the larger problem, your familiarity with previous work, and your expected attack on specific sub-problems. In addition to direct feedback, the committee will also report to the PAS."],"link":["https://www.cs.rochester.edu/graduate/phd-proposal.html"]}
